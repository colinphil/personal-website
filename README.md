# Personal Website
This is a first iteration of a portfolio website using GatsbyJS and customized Boostrap components,
hosted on Github Pages. The site was inspired by Brittany Chiang's personal website; rather than 
using her template, I built everything from scratch to both get some practice and add the customization
I wanted. I'm currently working on developing a template, stay tuned!
